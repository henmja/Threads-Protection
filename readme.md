# Thread Protection

Program to demonstrate a data race, and protection.

There is a java version and a c version. Both programs serve the same purpose.

To run the threads without protection use cmd line argument '--without-protection' in this case, the program will eventually fail due to lack of protection of a global resource).
To run the program with protection use argument '--with-protection'.
